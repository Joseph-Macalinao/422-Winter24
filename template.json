I think this template was a very bad idea (my fault)
--> it should probably be a singular json object that contains each department as a property
    rather than a singular property that contains all departments in a list

    i.e. 
    department_database = 
        {
        "AA": {
            "classes":[]
            "Regular_Faculty":[]
            }
        "AAA": {
            (...)
            }
        }
Do you think changing it to this new format is reasonably easy?
