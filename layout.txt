main.py will be the main python file for the system. It will…

    -Import all other files
    -Process requests sent by front end
    -Send requests to their corresponding files

graph.py to graph (takes as a parameter the different ways that someone might want to view data) 

    -This file should graph the data (figure out how to parse from a local file.. Assuming it’s JS for now. CSV is fine.)
    -Using matplotlib
    -This should graph the data directly onto the website… if possible… if not possible, come up with other solution. 

admin.py A file that takes care of admin requests and special privileges. 
    -This will include tampering with data in the js file, writing to / writing over the js file in general.
    -scraper.py to get the data
    -From the wayback
    -This will most likely be called by admin.py
    -Not understanding this part.
